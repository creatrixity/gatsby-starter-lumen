I'm delighted to know you want to learn more about me.

I'm (primarily) a JavaScript Engineer equally competent on both the client & the server. Currently struggling to keep a love affair with Python secret. In my downtime, I create tools (like [Adonis Authentication Scaffold](https://github.com/creatrixity/adonis-auth-scaffold)) to increase development velocity and I'm really keen on software architecture so I created the [Hexa framework](https://github.com/creatrixity/adonis-hexa) to incorporate some really cool development ideas.

When I'm not coding (or reading the most fashionable conspiracy theories), I'm likely on some culinary experiment or struggling at Chess.
