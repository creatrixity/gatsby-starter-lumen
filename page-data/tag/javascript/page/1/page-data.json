We then proceeded to implement lazy loading within our application using the `react-loadable` NPM package. We also created some custom styled components for our application.\nToday, we'll do just a little bit more. We'll setup a state management system for our application. We'll also setup route transition animations for smoother switches from one route to another."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/pt-2-build-a-css-in-js-react-app-with-styled-components-and-priceline-design-system/","categorySlug":"/category/front-end/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pt 2: Build a CSS-in-JS React App with Styled Components and Priceline Design System","date":"2018-05-18T23:46:37.121Z","category":"Front End","description":"Last time on this series, we explored the CSS-in-JS paradigm and code splitting with Webpack. We also built a minimal app interface that uses styled components for displaying notable lines from hip hop verses.\nToday, we'll do some more development. We'll learn how to lazy-load on-demand route based code (i.e code specific to a certain route). We'll also explore more Priceline components and create some of our own components that leverage preexisting Priceline components.

On the web, we can enhance the performance of our application as regards loading time by minimizing the number of HTTP requests we make for critical assets. If we can reduce the number of requests for CSS and JavaScript assets our application makes, we get improved load times."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Javascript","currentPage":1,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":4,"prevPagePath":"/tag/javascript","nextPagePath":"/tag/javascript/page/2","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","4120999787"]}
